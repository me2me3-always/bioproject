    <h1>Cancer Patients Suffering in the War Zones</h1>
    <p>
     <br> Cancer patients in Gaza urgently need basic health care services‚Äîa situation further complicated by restrictions on essential medical supplies, including chemotherapy drugs. The Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital, the sole facility in Gaza specializing in treating cancer, has closed because of frequent Israeli attacks and a lack of fuel and medical supplies.</br>

      <br>The deaths of at least 12 cancer patients were documented 10 days following its closure. Despite some international efforts to evacuate cancer patients, of Gaza‚Äôs estimated 10,000 cancer patients, approximately 3,800 have been granted permission to leave. However, in reality, only around 600 have been evacuated since the start of the war.</br>
      
     <br> Thousands of Palestinians with cancer are trapped by Israel's blockade, denied treatment abroad, and left to die as the world looks away.</br>
      
    <br>  Not only Palestine, but countries like Syria, Yemen, Democratic Republic Of Congo and many more who have citizens suffering with the misery of cancer but have no humanitarian aid, healthcare facilities and basic resources. With the wars actively going on, people are exposed to carcinogens every single day and the risk of cancer increases in everyone, including babies and pregnant women.</br>

     <br> A donation to them equals a donation for their survival. Every $1 equals aid for a child with cancer. Your humanity helps these citizens.</br>
